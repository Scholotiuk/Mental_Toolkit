## 1\) Razors (Heuristics for Cutting Noise)

Razors are rule‑of‑thumb filters. They don’t prove truth; they help prioritize what to test, read, or do next.

### 1.1 Occam’s Razor

- **Definition:** Prefer the simplest explanation that fits the evidence.  
- **Origin:** Attributed to William of Ockham (14th c.).  
- **Historical context:** Heliocentrism vs. Ptolemaic epicycles—Copernicus/Kepler offered a simpler, more predictive model.  
- **Pitfalls:** Simpler ≠ truer (Newtonian mechanics is simpler than relativity but incomplete).  
- **Use when:** Competing explanations vary mostly in complexity; data is limited.  
- **Anti‑razor:** **Hickam’s Dictum** (see 1.6) — reality can require multiple causes.

### 1.2 Hanlon’s Razor

- **Definition:** Don’t attribute to malice what is adequately explained by error, noise, or incentives.  
- **Historical context:** Many bureaucratic failures (e.g., industrial accidents) stem from design flaws and human factors more than conspiracy.  
- **Pitfalls:** Malice and adversarial behavior do exist; don’t be naïve in security contexts.  
- **Use when:** Diagnosing organizational mishaps, interpreting ambiguous motives.

### 1.3 Hitchens’ Razor

- **Definition:** What is asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.  
- **Origin:** Christopher Hitchens.  
- **Historical context:** Pseudoscientific movements (phrenology, perpetual motion machines) collapsed when evidence standards were enforced.  
- **Pitfalls:** Some claims are true but hard to evidence quickly; keep a parking lot for later testing.

### 1.4 Sagan Standard

- **Definition:** Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.  
- **Historical context:** SETI and cold fusion episodes show why stringent proof thresholds matter.  
- **Pitfalls:** Don’t move goalposts indefinitely; define “extraordinary” in advance when you can.

### 1.5 Newton’s Flaming Laser Sword (Alder’s Razor)

- **Definition:** If a dispute cannot be settled by observation or experiment, it’s not worth (long) debate.  
- **Origin:** Mike Alder (2004).  
- **Historical context:** Physics progressed by testable predictions (e.g., Eddington’s 1919 eclipse test of general relativity).  
- **Pitfalls:** Ethics, policy, and aesthetics still matter despite being hard to test.

### 1.6 Hickam’s Dictum (Medicine’s counter‑Occam)

- **Definition:** “Patients can have as many diseases as they damn well please.”  
- **Use:** Counterbalances over‑simplification; multiple causes are common in complex systems.  
- **Example:** Multi‑factor industrial failures (design \+ training \+ environment).

### 1.7 Chesterton’s Fence

- **Definition:** Don’t remove a rule or institution until you understand why it exists.  
- **Historical context:** Abrupt policy reversals often backfire when hidden functions (e.g., safety margins) are removed.  
- **Pitfalls:** Can become an excuse for complacency; understand *and* reform carefully.

### 1.8 Principle of Charity (Gricean/Interpretive Razor)

- **Definition:** Interpret others’ statements in their strongest, most coherent form first.  
- **Use:** Negotiations, reading opponents, cross‑disciplinary work.  
- **Pitfalls:** Bad‑faith actors exist; calibrate with signals of cooperation/defection.

### 1.9 Popper’s Falsifiability Filter

- **Definition:** A claim is scientific if it exposes itself to potential refutation by evidence.  
- **Use:** Prioritize testable hypotheses; design pivotal experiments.  
- **Pitfalls:** Useful outside science too, but not all truths are empirical.

### 1.10 Incentives Razor (“Follow the Incentives”)

- **Definition:** When behavior seems puzzling, map incentives; expect people to respond to them.  
- **Historical context:** Regulatory arbitrage, moral hazard in finance, agency problems in firms.  
- **Pitfalls:** Over‑reducing motives to money; status and identity can dominate.

### 1.11 Gall’s Law (Complexity Caution)

- **Definition:** Complex systems that work evolved from simpler systems that worked.  
- **Use:** Build iteratively; prototype → scale.  
- **Pitfalls:** Not an excuse to avoid ambitious design—sequence it.

### 1.12 Linus’s Law (Transparency Razor)

- **Definition:** “Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.”  
- **Use:** Peer review, red teaming, open processes.  
- **Pitfalls:** Diffusion of responsibility; needs aligned incentives.

### 1.13 Occam’s Broom (Cautionary)

- **Definition:** The tendency to sweep inconvenient facts under the rug of simplicity.  
- **Use:** Watch for cherry‑picking that masquerades as parsimony.

### 1.14 Pareto Principle (80/20 Razor)

- **Definition:** A small share of causes often produces a large share of effects.  
- **Use:** Prioritize high‑leverage actions, customers, risks.  
- **Pitfalls:** Not a law of nature; verify distribution shape (power‑law or not).

### 1.15 Littlewood’s Law (On “Miracles”)

- **Definition:** Given enough opportunities, rare events happen regularly.  
- **Use:** Calibrate surprise; expect “once‑in‑a‑lifetime” events to occur in large populations.

**Razors — Quick Checklist**

- Have I mapped incentives?  
- Am I oversimplifying (Occam) or overcomplicating (Hickam)?  
- Is there testable evidence (Hitchens/Popper/Alder)?  
- What function might this rule/institution serve (Chesterton)?  
- Am I pruning with data, or sweeping facts under the rug (Broom)?

## 2\) Cognitive Biases (Mental Traps & Mitigations)

Biases are systematic errors in judgment. Name them, and you can often neutralize them.

Each entry: **Definition • Historical/Everyday Example • Mitigate**

1. **Confirmation Bias** — Seek/interpret evidence that fits prior beliefs.  
   *Example:* Intelligence analysis during the Cold War over‑weighted ambiguous signals that fit expectations.  
   *Mitigate:* Pre‑mortems; adversarial review; deliberately seek disconfirming data.  
     
2. **Anchoring** — First number/frame skews estimates.  
   *Example:* Initial list price shapes real estate negotiations.  
   *Mitigate:* Generate independent estimates before seeing anchors; use ranges.  
     
3. **Availability Heuristic** — Vivid/recent events feel more probable.  
   *Example:* Plane crash news spikes fear vs. actual risk.  
   *Mitigate:* Base rates; look for denominators and long‑run frequencies.  
     
4. **Hindsight Bias** — “Knew‑it‑all‑along” after outcomes are known.  
   *Example:* Market crashes explained post hoc as “obvious.”  
   *Mitigate:* Write predictions with timestamps; keep a decision journal.  
     
5. **Outcome Bias** — Judge decisions by results, not the process/odds.  
   *Example:* Good outcomes from reckless bets seen as “skill.”  
   *Mitigate:* Evaluate ex‑ante quality; use expected value.  
     
6. **Sunk Cost Fallacy** — Past investment traps future decisions.  
   *Example:* Projects kept alive “because we’ve spent too much to stop.”  
   *Mitigate:* Focus on future costs/benefits; separate owner from evaluator.  
     
7. **Loss Aversion** — Losses hurt ≈2× more than equivalent gains please.  
   *Example:* Investors hold losers too long; sell winners too early.  
   *Mitigate:* Pre‑commit exit rules; automate rebalancing.  
     
8. **Status Quo Bias** — Prefer current state even when change is better.  
   *Example:* Clinging to legacy processes despite poor performance.  
   *Mitigate:* “Re‑sign” to the status quo each quarter with explicit choice.  
     
9. **Endowment Effect** — Overvalue what we own.  
   *Example:* Homeowners’ overpricing relative to buyers’ valuations.  
   *Mitigate:* Ask, “If I didn’t own this, would I buy it at this price?”  
     
10. **Framing Effect** — Different wording → different decisions.  
    *Example:* 90% survival vs. 10% mortality frames.  
    *Mitigate:* Reframe in multiple ways; standardize presentations.  
      
11. **Base‑Rate Neglect** — Ignore prior probabilities.  
    *Example:* Interpreting medical test positives without prevalence rates.  
    *Mitigate:* Start with base rates; then apply likelihood ratios.  
      
12. **Survivorship Bias** — Focus on winners; miss silent failures.  
    *Example:* WWII aircraft armor — Abraham Wald’s insight to reinforce where returning planes had *no* holes.  
    *Mitigate:* Ask “Who/what’s missing from the sample?”  
      
13. **Fundamental Attribution Error** — Over‑attribute to character vs context.  
    *Example:* Blaming individuals for systemic constraints.  
    *Mitigate:* Map situational factors and incentives first.  
      
14. **Self‑Serving Bias** — Credit successes internally, blame failures externally.  
    *Mitigate:* External audits; symmetric criteria for credit/blame.  
      
15. **Halo/Horn Effects** — One trait colors all others.  
    *Mitigate:* Blind evaluations; structured scorecards by dimension.  
      
16. **Planning Fallacy** — Underestimate time/costs despite history.  
    *Mitigate:* Reference‑class forecasting; add buffers.  
      
17. **Overconfidence** — Excessive certainty in estimates and abilities.  
    *Mitigate:* Calibration training; 90% confidence intervals checked against reality.  
      
18. **Recency Bias** — Overweight recent data.  
    *Mitigate:* Rolling windows; decay functions with rationale.  
      
19. **Bandwagon (Herding)** — Conform to group despite private signals.  
    *Mitigate:* Anonymous first‑round estimates; devil’s advocate role.  
      
20. **Authority Bias** — Defer to perceived experts/leaders.  
    *Mitigate:* Separate evidence from rank; run “red‑team” challenges.  
      
21. **In‑Group / Out‑Group Bias** — Favor insiders; distrust outsiders.  
    *Mitigate:* Diverse review panels; rotate roles; use shared goals.  
      
22. **Ambiguity Aversion** — Prefer known risks to unknown risks.  
    *Mitigate:* Value information; stage decisions to learn (real options).  
      
23. **Negativity Bias** — Negative info dominates attention.  
    *Mitigate:* Balanced scorecards; equal airtime for upside/downside.  
      
24. **Present Bias (Hyperbolic Discounting)** — Overvalue immediate rewards.  
    *Mitigate:* Pre‑commitment devices; default savings/investment plans.  
      
25. **Selection Bias** — Non‑random sampling skews conclusions.  
    *Mitigate:* Define sampling frame; track who’s excluded.  
      
26. **Simpson’s Paradox (Caution)** — Trends reverse when data combined.  
    *Mitigate:* Segment appropriately; check confounders.  
      
27. **Curse of Knowledge** — Experts forget what novices don’t know.  
    *Mitigate:* Teach‑back method; user‑testing of instructions.  
      
28. **Optimism/Pessimism Bias** — Systematic skew in forecasting.  
    *Mitigate:* Compare to base rates; scenario ranges with weights.  
      
29. **Ostrich Effect** — Avoiding negative information.  
    *Mitigate:* Force surfacing of bad news; dashboards with leading indicators.  
      
30. **Mere Exposure Effect** — Familiarity breeds liking.  
    *Mitigate:* Rotate options; test blind against newcomers.

**Biases — Quick Checklist**

- What’s the base rate? What sample is missing?  
- What anchors/frames are shaping us?  
- What would I believe if the outcome were opposite?  
- If we hadn’t started this, would we start it now (sunk cost)?  
- Have we run an adversarial/independent review?

## 3\) Mental Models (Portable Tools for Thinking)

Models help you reason about structure, causality, scale, and trade‑offs.

Each entry: **Definition • Historical/Everyday Example • Apply**

### 3.1 First Principles

- Reduce to irreducible facts/constraints; rebuild from there.  
- *Example:* Re‑pricing batteries from raw materials rather than legacy vendor quotes.  
- *Apply:* When incumbents say “it can’t be done” — derive costs from fundamentals.

### 3.2 Second‑Order Effects

- Consider consequences of consequences.  
- *Example:* Versailles Treaty (1919) → destabilization → WWII.  
- *Apply:* Policy design, product incentives, environmental regulation.

### 3.3 Inversion

- Think backward: “How do we guarantee failure?”  
- *Example:* Aviation and nuclear safety cultures derive rules from accident analyses.  
- *Apply:* Pre‑mortems; design‑for‑failure.

### 3.4 Expected Value (EV)

- Weight outcomes by probability; choose high‑EV actions under repeatable bets.  
- *Example:* Insurance pricing, poker strategy, portfolio sizing.  
- *Apply:* Separate one‑off gambles from repeatable processes.

### 3.5 Optionality (Real Options)

- Small, reversible bets to learn; scale winners.  
- *Example:* Pharmaceutical R\&D pipelines; venture portfolios.  
- *Apply:* Stage‑gated funding; option‑like projects.

### 3.6 Margin of Safety

- Build buffers against model error and variance.  
- *Example:* Engineering safety factors; value investing discounts.  
- *Apply:* Critical infrastructure, capital allocation, scheduling.

### 3.7 Redundancy

- Independent backups for critical functions.  
- *Example:* Multiple power feeds; RAID with off‑site backups.  
- *Apply:* Distinguish redundancy from fragility‑adding complexity.

### 3.8 Compounding

- Small rates → large effects over time.  
- *Example:* Interest, learning curves, network adoption.  
- *Apply:* Maximize time‑in‑system; avoid interrupting compounding.

### 3.9 Power Laws

- Fat‑tailed distributions where few dominate outcomes.  
- *Example:* City sizes, startup outcomes, creative hits.  
- *Apply:* Expect outliers; design for asymmetric upside.

### 3.10 Mean Reversion

- Deviations move back toward long‑run averages (in some systems).  
- *Apply:* Beware extrapolating booms/slumps; identify when regime shifts break it.

### 3.11 Bottlenecks (Theory of Constraints)

- A system’s throughput is limited by its narrowest point.  
- *Apply:* Map flow; elevate and exploit the constraint first.

### 3.12 Feedback Loops

- **Reinforcing:** amplify (network effects). **Balancing:** stabilize (thermostats).  
- *Apply:* Identify loops; watch for runaway dynamics or dampers.

### 3.13 Network Effects

- Value increases with number of users/connections.  
- *Apply:* Cold‑start strategies; seeding critical sides in two‑sided markets.

### 3.14 Comparative Advantage

- Specialize where your relative cost is lowest; trade for the rest.  
- *Historical:* Ricardo’s trade theory.  
- *Apply:* Team/firm strategy and outsourcing.

### 3.15 Equilibrium / Price Discovery

- Prices aggregate dispersed information.  
- *Apply:* Use markets/auctions to allocate scarce resources.

### 3.16 Principal–Agent Problem

- Agents optimize their incentives, not principals’ goals.  
- *Apply:* Contract design, monitoring, equity alignment.

### 3.17 Tragedy of the Commons

- Individual incentives overuse shared resources.  
- *Apply:* Quotas, tradable permits, norms, property rights.

### 3.18 OODA Loop (Observe–Orient–Decide–Act)

- Rapid cycles beat slower opponents via faster adaptation.  
- *Historical:* John Boyd’s air combat theory.  
- *Apply:* Competitive strategy; crisis management.

### 3.19 Barbell Strategy

- Combine very safe with very risky; avoid the fragile middle.  
- *Apply:* Portfolio construction; R\&D exploration/exploitation.

### 3.20 Lindy Effect

- For non‑perishables (ideas, books), future life expectancy rises with current age.  
- *Apply:* Weight durable knowledge; mix with frontier research.

**Models — Quick Checklist**

- What’s the bottleneck?  
- What are the feedback loops and second‑order effects?  
- Where do we have optionality and margin of safety?  
- Are incentives aligned (principal–agent)?  
- What does EV say if we treat this as a repeatable bet?

## 4\) Game Theory (Strategic Interaction & Practice)

Model how rational (and boundedly rational) actors behave when outcomes depend on each other’s choices.

### 4.1 Core Concepts

- **Dominant Strategy:** Best action regardless of others.  
- **Nash Equilibrium:** No player can improve by unilateral deviation (John Nash, 1950).  
- **Subgame‑Perfect Equilibrium:** Credible strategies at every point in sequential games.  
- **Mixed Strategies:** Randomization to stay unpredictable (e.g., penalty kicks).  
- **Repeated Games:** “Shadow of the future” can sustain cooperation.  
- **Bayesian Games:** Incomplete information; beliefs and signaling matter.  
- **Correlated Equilibrium:** Players coordinate via shared signals (Aumann).  
- **Mechanism Design:** Engineer the rules so that self‑interest yields desired outcomes.

### 4.2 Classic Games & What They Teach

- **Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD):** Individually rational defection → collectively worse outcome.  
  *Historical lens:* Nuclear arms races and cartel cheating echo PD tensions.  
  *Practice:* Reputation, repeated play, and enforcement can enable cooperation.  
    
- **Stag Hunt:** Safe solo payoff vs. risky high payoff requiring mutual trust.  
  *Practice:* Standards adoption, joint ventures, social contract formation.  
    
- **Battle of the Sexes:** Coordination with different preferred equilibria.  
  *Practice:* Platform defaults, industry standards—pre‑commitment and focal points help.  
    
- **Chicken (Hawk–Dove):** Escalation vs. yielding; brinkmanship.  
  *Historical:* Cuban Missile Crisis signaling and credible commitment.  
  *Practice:* Do not bluff commitments you can’t keep; remove your own escape routes to signal resolve (Schelling).  
    
- **Ultimatum Game:** Fairness norms constrain “rational” acceptance.  
  *Practice:* Culture matters; proposals must be procedurally fair to pass.  
    
- **Public Goods Game / Tragedy of the Commons:** Under‑provision without incentives.  
  *Practice:* Matching, punishment, or norms to sustain contributions.

### 4.3 Applications & Case Notes

- **Deterrence & Arms Control:** Credible second‑strike → MAD equilibrium; verification builds trust.  
- **Oligopoly Pricing:** Tacit coordination in repeated interaction (airlines, telecom).  
- **Auctions & Mechanism Design:** Vickrey auctions; FCC spectrum auctions—careful design improves efficiency and revenue.  
- **Signaling & Screening:** Education as a signal; insurance deductibles as screening.  
- **AI & Multi‑Agent Systems:** Self‑play (AlphaGo); debate/consensus games to improve model reliability.

### 4.4 Playbook

- Identify players, payoffs, information, and timing.  
- Look for dominant strategies and potential equilibria.  
- If PD‑like, build shadow of the future: repetition, reputation, punishment.  
- Use pre‑commitment, credible threats/promises (Schelling).  
- Change the game: adjust payoffs, add monitoring, alter information structure.

**Game Theory — Quick Checklist**

- What game are we in (PD, Stag Hunt, Chicken, Coordination)?  
- One‑shot or repeated? What’s the discount factor (how much we value future)?  
- What signals/commitments are credible?  
- Can we redesign rules/incentives (mechanism design)?

- **Context:** What decision, by when, with what constraints?  
- **Options:** A/B/C with EV ranges and risk profiles.  
- **Razors Applied:** Simplicity vs. completeness; incentives mapped; testability.  
- **Bias Audit:** Anchors, base rates, sunk costs, groupthink checks.  
- **Models Used:** Second‑order, feedback loops, bottleneck, principal–agent.  
- **Game‑Theoretic View:** Players, incentives, likely equilibria; how to shift the game.  
- **Recommendation:** Chosen option \+ kill criteria \+ next review date.

### 6.2 Pre‑Mortem (Inversion)

- “It’s 12 months later and this failed. What happened?” Collect reasons; address top risks now.

### 6.3 Crisis Simulation Drills

- **Scenarios:** Liquidity crunch; supply chain shock; data breach; regulatory shift.  
- **Exercise:** 60‑min tabletop — apply Razors → Bias Audit → Models → Game Theory.  
- **Output:** Action plan; monitoring metrics; pre‑commitments; communication map.

## 8\) Quick Reference Checklists (Printer‑Friendly)

**A. Razors**

- Have we mapped incentives and testability?  
- Are we removing a “fence” we don’t yet understand?  
- Are we oversimplifying a multi‑cause reality?

**B. Biases**

- What are the base rates? What’s missing from the sample?  
- What anchors/frames are driving us?  
- Are we judging process or just outcome?

**C. Models**

- Bottleneck? Feedback loops? Second‑order effects?  
- EV and optionality: what can we learn cheaply now?  
- Margin of safety: where’s our buffer?

**D. Game Theory**

- One‑shot vs. repeated? Discount factor?  
- Credible signals/commitments? Can we change the payoffs?  
- What equilibrium are we heading toward, and do we want it?
