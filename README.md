## **Toolkit Roadmap**

### **v1 – Core Foundations *(what you already built)***

* **Razors** (Occam, Hanlon, Chesterton, etc.)

* **Cognitive Biases** (Kahneman/Tversky \+ others)

* **Mental Models** (first principles, feedback loops, inversion, etc.)

* **Game Theory Basics** (Prisoner’s Dilemma, Stag Hunt, Chicken, signaling)

**Outcome**: A compact manual for clearer thinking and sharper decision-making.

---

### **v2 – Historical Context & Cycles**

* Add **History & Cycles** section: turning points (Meiji Restoration, Oil Crisis, Soviet collapse, etc.)

* Add **Patterns**: elite overproduction, financial manias, centralization vs decentralization, resource crunches.

* Begin case studies with annotated biases/models/game-theory insights.

**Outcome**: Not just abstract tools, but grounded in how history *actually* plays out.

---

### **v3 – Power & Influence**

* Integrate **48 Laws of Power** (curated \+ adapted to toolkit format).

* Cross-link to biases (envy, authority bias), models (principal–agent, signaling), and game theory.

* Add **persuasion & negotiation basics** (Cialdini, *Getting to Yes*).

**Outcome**: Toolkit covers interpersonal and political dimensions, not just abstract/systemic thinking.

---

### **v4 – Communication & Marketing**

* Build **Communication Appendix**: Storytelling (Heath brothers, StoryBrand), Virality (Berger), Narrative Economics (Shiller).

* Add **Message Design heuristics**: sticky ideas, positioning, framing, “contagious” content.

* Practical **growth & funnel thinking** (Traction, Hacking Growth).

**Outcome**: Toolkit can shape not only strategy but how strategy is *communicated and spread*.

---

### **v5 – Community & Cooperation**

* Add **Community/Co-op Toolkit**: building trust, governance, collective ownership, conflict resolution (Ludwig, Wheatley, coop economics).

* Include **online community lessons** (Bacon, Amy Jo Kim, Powazek).

* Practical frameworks for **culture audits** and co-op resilience.

**Outcome**: Extends toolkit from individual decisions to group formation, trust, and governance.

---

### **v6 – Resilience & Foresight**

* Add **Antifragility & Preparedness**: Taleb, Meadows, resilience engineering.

* Build **Scenario Planning module**: Fourth Turning, Turchin, scenario drills.

* Add **crisis simulations** and red-team/war-game templates.

**Outcome**: Toolkit becomes a living playbook for navigating volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity.

---

### **v7 – Meta Layer**

* Develop **exercises, drills, and case templates** for each section.

* Create **quick reference cards** for fast recall.

* Optionally: Open-source it → invite peers/colleagues to add case studies and heuristics.

**Outcome**: Toolkit shifts from “manual” to “living operating system for strategic thinking.”
