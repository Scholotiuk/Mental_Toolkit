# The Fourth Turning: An American Prophecy – What the Cycles of History Tell Us About America’s Next Rendevous with Destiny – Reference Guide

## Overview

Published in 1997, **“The Fourth Turning”** by **William Strauss and Neil Howe** presents a generational theory of history, positing that Anglo‑American society moves through recurring 80‑ to 100‑year cycles, each comprising four distinct “turnings.” According to the authors, the United States is headed toward a **Fourth Turning**—a period of crisis and upheaval comparable to the Revolutionary War, Civil War and Great Depression/World War II. The book offers predictions and prescriptions for navigating this forthcoming era.

## The Generational Theory

### 1. Generational Archetypes

Strauss and Howe identify four generational archetypes recurring in a fixed order:

1. **Prophets (Idealists)** – Born during a High. They grow up in a period of confidence and cultural resurgence, become spiritual and moral leaders in midlife (e.g., Baby Boomers). Traits: values‑driven, visionary, principled.
2. **Nomads (Reactives)** – Born during an Awakening. They grow up amid social upheaval, become pragmatic and independent in midlife (e.g., Generation X). Traits: resilient, cynical, resourceful.
3. **Heroes (Civics)** – Born during an Unraveling. They grow up during individualism and fragmentation, become cooperative institution‑builders during a crisis (e.g., Millennials). Traits: confident, team‑oriented, ambitious.
4. **Artists (Adaptives)** – Born during a Crisis. They grow up in crisis conditions, protected by adults, and become sensitive and conformist in midlife (e.g., Generation Z). Traits: empathetic, compromising, caring.

These archetypes repeat sequentially every cycle.

### 2. The Four Turnings

Each cycle comprises four approximately 20‑ to 25‑year turnings:

1. **High** – A post‑crisis era of strong institutions, social harmony and collective purpose. Society feels confident about its direction. Individualism is suppressed.
2. **Awakening** – A period of spiritual revival and challenge to established institutions. People seek personal and cultural autonomy. Social ideals rise, institutions weaken.
3. **Unraveling** – A time of growing individualism, weak civic institutions and social fragmentation. Culture becomes more self‑centered; politics divisive.
4. **Crisis (Fourth Turning)** – A decisive era of upheaval and reordering of society’s institutional and economic structures. Collective sacrifices are made to resolve existential threats. A new civic order emerges.

These turnings follow one another in linear sequence, forming a cyclic pattern over centuries.

## Historical Cycles in Anglo‑American History

Strauss and Howe apply their framework to Anglo‑American history, identifying cycles:

1. **The Colonial Cycle** (1435–1675)
2. **The Revolutionary Cycle** (1675–1794)
3. **The Civil War Cycle** (1794–1865)
4. **The Great Power Cycle** (1865–1945)
5. **The Millennial Cycle** (1945–present)

The cycles follow High, Awakening, Unraveling and Crisis turnings. For example:

- **High**: Post–World War II prosperity and social unity (1946–1964).
- **Awakening**: Cultural upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s (1964–1984).
- **Unraveling**: Political polarization and market liberalization of the 1980s and 1990s (1984–2005).
- **Crisis**: The authors predicted a Fourth Turning beginning in the mid‑2000s, culminating in a climactic event in the 2020s.

## Predictions and Scenario for the Fourth Turning

Strauss and Howe anticipated that the U.S. would enter a crisis phase around 2005, triggered by economic instability, institutional decay and geopolitical threats. They foresaw challenges such as:

- Financial crises and debt problems.
- Rising inequality and generational tensions.
- Declining trust in government and civic institutions.
- External threats (terrorism, geopolitical rivals, environmental disasters).

During the Fourth Turning, a Hero generation (Millennials) would rise to leadership roles, guided by ideals articulated by an earlier Prophet generation (Baby Boomers). The crisis would produce sweeping institutional reforms and a renewed sense of community and national purpose.

## Criticism and Skepticism

- **Determinism**: Critics argue that Strauss and Howe’s theory is overly deterministic, forcing complex historical events into a rigid cyclical framework.
- **Selection bias**: The authors select examples that fit the pattern while ignoring counterexamples. The lengths of cycles vary and are sometimes stretched to fit the theory.
- **Predictive accuracy**: While some elements of the Fourth Turning scenario (e.g., financial crises) have occurred, the theory lacks precise predictive power.

## Legacy and Influence

“The Fourth Turning” has influenced political discourse, particularly among policy makers and commentators who see value in generational analysis. It has been referenced in discussions about millennial politics, economic policy and social change. The book gained renewed attention during the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent political upheavals.

## Practical Takeaways

- **Importance of generational dynamics**: Different generations have distinct formative experiences that shape their behaviors and values. Understanding these can improve intergenerational communication and policy design.
- **Expect cyclical change**: Institutions and social norms are not static; they evolve in waves of reform and backlash. Planning should account for long‑term cycles.
- **Leadership opportunities**: Crisis periods open opportunities for new leaders and ideas to shape the future. Cultivating resilience and adaptability is critical.

## Conclusion

**“The Fourth Turning”** proposes that history follows a repeating pattern of generational cycles culminating in recurring crises. While the predictive aspects of the theory remain debated, it offers a lens for interpreting social change and intergenerational dynamics. Whether or not one accepts the determinism of the cycles, the book’s insights encourage long‑term thinking about societal evolution and the role of collective sacrifice in forging new civic orders.
