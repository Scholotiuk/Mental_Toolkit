# Good Strategy / Bad Strategy – Reference Guide

## Overview

**“Good Strategy / Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters”** by **Richard P. Rumelt** (2011) distinguishes between effective and ineffective strategies in business, government and personal contexts. Rumelt argues that many so‑called “strategies” are vague slogans or wishful thinking rather than actionable plans grounded in analysis. He offers a framework for crafting a **good strategy** and diagnosing **bad strategy**, illustrated with examples from corporate and military history.

## Key Concepts

### Good Strategy

A good strategy has three essential elements:

1. **A clear diagnosis**: Identify the critical issues or challenges facing the organization. This involves deep analysis of the environment, competition, internal capabilities and hidden constraints.
2. **Guiding policy**: Develop an overarching approach to address the diagnosis. The policy should concentrate resources and attention on pivotal aspects rather than scatter efforts.
3. **Coherent actions**: Implement coordinated steps that align with the guiding policy and address the diagnosis. These actions reinforce each other to create leverage.

### Bad Strategy

Rumelt characterizes bad strategy by several common traits:

- **Fluff**: Jargon and clichés masquerading as insight. Vague aspirational statements lacking substance (e.g., “Our vision is to be number one”).
- **Failure to face the problem**: Avoiding tough choices or ignoring significant challenges. Without confronting obstacles, strategy becomes empty.
- **Mistaking goals for strategy**: Setting ambitious goals (e.g., “double revenue in five years”) without explaining how to achieve them.
- **Bad objectives**: Introducing conflicting or impractical objectives that dilute focus.

## The Kernel of Good Strategy

Rumelt’s **kernel** comprises the diagnosis, guiding policy and coherent actions. These elements must align and mutually reinforce:

- **Diagnosis**: Distinguish problems from symptoms. For example, in a declining industry, the core problem might be overcapacity, not just sales decline.
- **Guiding policy**: Should be a general approach rather than a detailed plan. Example: IKEA’s guiding policy is to design, package and sell unassembled furniture to reduce costs and appeal to value-conscious consumers.
- **Coherent actions**: Implement decisions consistent with the policy. For IKEA, this includes store layouts, product designs and supply chain management that support the policy.

## Sources of Power

Rumelt identifies mechanisms through which strategies create leverage:

- **Anticipation**: Predicting competitor moves, technological shifts or market changes and preparing accordingly.
- **Pivot points**: Focusing on a critical resource or constraint that unlocks value (e.g., optimizing a bottleneck in a production process).
- **Chain link systems**: Recognizing how different activities fit together; weaknesses in one link compromise the whole system. Strategy may involve strengthening weak links or exploiting competitors’ weaknesses.
- **Focus**: Concentrating resources on a few key objectives to achieve disproportionate impact. Spreading resources thin dilutes effectiveness.
- **Growth through advantage**: Building on a distinctive capability or market position to create further advantages.

## Diagnosing Industry Structure

Rumelt recommends analyzing industry dynamics (e.g., using Porter’s Five Forces) but warns against formulaic approaches. Instead, strategists should look for peculiarities, changes and hidden opportunities in the specific context.

## Case Studies and Examples

- **Apple’s turnaround**: When Steve Jobs returned in 1997, he diagnosed Apple’s problem as product proliferation and unfocused R&D. He set a guiding policy to focus on a handful of innovative products and coherent actions such as canceling multiple projects, forging a partnership with Microsoft, and redesigning the product lineup.
- **Nvidia**: Faced with intense competition in graphics chips, CEO Jen‑Hsun Huang focused on rapid product cycles and targeted segments (gaming). The guiding policy was to be the first to market with new graphics capabilities, and actions included heavy investment in R&D and strategic partnerships.
- **Iraq War**: Rumelt critiques U.S. strategy after the 2003 invasion. The guiding policy (transition to democracy) lacked coherent actions addressing security, political fragmentation and infrastructure, illustrating bad strategy.
- **US rail freight deregulation**: Facing competition from trucking, the railroad industry lobbied for regulatory reform. The guiding policy was to free the industry from regulatory constraints, leading to coherent actions like lobbying and restructuring, which revitalized rail freight.

## Practical Steps for Crafting Good Strategy

1. **Define the challenge**: Understand the problem deeply. Use data, interviews and analysis to identify root causes.
2. **Identify leverage points**: Look for factors where a small effort could produce large effects. These may be bottlenecks, cultural shifts or emerging technologies.
3. **Choose guiding policies**: Develop general approaches that directly address the diagnosed challenge. Avoid one‑size‑fits‑all templates; tailor policies to the situation.
4. **Design coherent actions**: Create a sequence of actions that support the policy. Ensure resources, structures and processes align.
5. **Communicate clearly**: Articulate the strategy in a way that can be understood and executed at all levels. Avoid fluff and jargon.
6. **Adapt and learn**: Monitor outcomes, gather feedback and adjust as necessary. Strategy is iterative, not fixed.

## Conclusion

**“Good Strategy / Bad Strategy”** challenges conventional thinking by emphasizing that strategy is not a vision or a list of goals. Instead, it is an integrated set of choices grounded in a clear understanding of challenges and opportunities. Good strategy focuses on critical issues, develops guiding policies and coordinates actions to create leverage. Bad strategy fails to confront problems, relies on buzzwords and confuses ambition with strategy. Rumelt’s framework encourages leaders to think deeply and act deliberately to achieve meaningful results.
