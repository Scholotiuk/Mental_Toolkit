# This Is Marketing: You Can’t Be Seen Until You Learn to See – Reference Guide

## Overview

In **“This Is Marketing: You Can’t Be Seen Until You Learn to See,”** acclaimed marketer **Seth Godin** (2018) reframes marketing as the practice of solving other people’s problems and making change for the better. Rather than focusing on advertising tricks or mass appeal, Godin emphasizes empathy, respect, and community building. The book distills his decades of insights into concise, actionable ideas for entrepreneurs, creatives and anyone seeking to make an impact.

## Core Principles

### 1. Marketing Is About Change

- Marketing’s purpose is to effect change—helping people solve a problem or achieve a desired future. It is not simply about selling a product or service.
- To create change, marketers must understand the **worldview** of the people they seek to serve.

### 2. Smallest Viable Market

- Instead of trying to reach everyone, focus on the **smallest viable audience**—a tightly defined group for whom your offering is perfect.
- Serving this group well builds trust and creates advocates who spread the word. Growth comes from depth of connection rather than breadth of reach.

### 3. Empathy and Generosity

- Effective marketing starts with empathy: understanding your audience’s desires, fears and aspirations.
- Generosity means creating value and building trust before asking for anything in return. Give people something worthwhile—knowledge, inspiration, entertainment—without expecting an immediate sale.

### 4. Storytelling and Positioning

- Stories shape how people perceive products and brands. A compelling story aligns with the audience’s worldview and emotionally resonates.
- Positioning is about occupying a distinct place in the market and in people’s minds. It relates to the “difference that makes a difference.”

### 5. The Funnel and the Transmission

- Godin expands on the idea of the marketing funnel: awareness, trust, trial, purchase, and advocacy. Each stage requires different messages and interactions.
- “Tension” drives movement through the funnel: create a gap between the audience’s current state and desired state, then offer a path to close it.

### 6. Permission and Enrollment

- Rather than interrupting people, Godin advocates for **permission marketing**: obtaining consent to communicate. People opt in because they trust you and find value in what you offer.
- Enrollment occurs when people voluntarily commit to your mission or product. It results from resonance and trust.

### 7. Building Tribes and Communities

- A **tribe** is a group of people connected to one another, a leader and an idea. The marketer’s role is to connect and lead by supporting the tribe’s shared values and goals.
- Community fosters loyalty and advocacy. Treat community members with respect and empower them to contribute.

### 8. The Long Game

- Marketing is a long‑term endeavor. Quick hacks and viral campaigns rarely lead to sustainable success.
- Patience, consistency and persistent empathy build lasting relationships and reputations.

## Practical Applications

### Identifying the Smallest Viable Market

1. **Define your audience**: Who specifically will benefit most from your product? Describe their demographics, psychographics and worldview.
2. **Understand their problem**: What tension are they experiencing? How does your solution reduce or eliminate that tension?
3. **Craft a story**: Develop a narrative that resonates with their worldview and explains how your offering transforms their situation.
4. **Test and refine**: Start with a small group. Collect feedback, adjust your product and messaging, and deepen connections before expanding.

### Creating Remarkable Products

- Godin argues that the product itself must be worth marketing. Mediocre products require heavy advertising; remarkable products spread because people want to share them.
- Focus on usefulness, design, emotional appeal and delivering on your promises.

### Channels and Tools

- While the book is less focused on technical tactics, Godin acknowledges the importance of finding the right channels—social media, email, events, partnerships—and using them to build relationships.
- Regardless of channel, the guiding principles remain: empathy, permission, consistency and value creation.

### Dealing with Competition

- Competition is part of any market. Rather than copying others, differentiate by focusing on a unique audience and delivering what they need in your distinctive way.

### Ethics and Responsibility

- Godin emphasizes ethical marketing: avoid manipulation, coercion or deception. Respect people’s autonomy and time.
- Long‑term trust is more valuable than short‑term gains from misleading tactics.

## Conclusion

**“This Is Marketing”** urges readers to rethink marketing as a humanistic, transformative practice. By focusing on the smallest viable market, understanding customer worldviews, telling resonant stories and building communities, marketers can create meaningful impact. Success comes from persistent empathy, generosity and ethical conduct. Godin’s principles apply not only to traditional marketers but to anyone who wishes to share an idea, build a business or make a difference.
