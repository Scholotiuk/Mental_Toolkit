# This Is Service Design Doing: Applying Service Design Thinking in the Real World – Reference Guide

## Overview

**“This Is Service Design Doing”** (2018) by **Marc Stickdorn**, **Markus Edgar Hormess**, **Adam Lawrence** and **Jakob Schneider** is a practical companion to the earlier book “This Is Service Design Thinking.” It provides detailed methods, tools and case studies for applying service design principles to create better services and customer experiences. The book targets practitioners across industries—designers, managers and consultants—who want to implement service design in their organizations.

## Key Concepts and Principles

### 1. Service Design Basics

- **Service**: An intangible product that often involves interactions between a provider and a customer. Services are co‑created by users and providers.
- **Service design**: A human-centered discipline that designs services to meet user needs and business goals. It uses holistic, iterative and collaborative processes.
- **Double diamond**: A visual model illustrating phases of service design: **Discover**, **Define**, **Develop** and **Deliver**. The first diamond expands and narrows understanding of the problem; the second explores and refines solutions.
- **Frontstage vs. backstage**: Services have visible frontstage interactions (customer touchpoints) and invisible backstage processes (systems, people) that enable them.

### 2. Principles of Service Design

1. **User-centered**: Understand the needs, goals and emotions of users. Involve them throughout the process.
2. **Co-creative**: Collaborate with stakeholders—customers, employees, partners—to design solutions.
3. **Sequencing**: Visualize services as sequences of actions and touchpoints (journeys) over time.
4. **Evidencing**: Make intangible services tangible through physical or digital artifacts (e.g., service blueprints, prototypes).
5. **Holistic**: Consider the entire ecosystem—frontstage, backstage, systems and contexts. Service design must integrate multiple perspectives.

### 3. The Service Design Process

#### Discover Phase

- **Research planning**: Define objectives, scope and participants. Choose methods such as interviews, ethnography, shadowing and desk research.
- **Customer journey mapping**: Visualize the steps customers take, including touchpoints, emotions and pain points.
- **Stakeholder mapping**: Identify all parties involved in the service ecosystem and their relationships.

#### Define Phase

- **Insight synthesis**: Analyze research findings, identify patterns and generate insights.
- **Personas**: Create archetypes representing key user segments. Personas capture motivations, behaviors and needs.
- **Problem statements**: Articulate core challenges or opportunities in clear, human-centered terms.

#### Develop Phase

- **Ideation**: Generate ideas through brainstorming, co‑creation workshops and design games.
- **Prototyping**: Create tangible or digital prototypes to test concepts. Prototypes can be low fidelity (paper sketches, role plays) or high fidelity (interactive mockups).
- **Service blueprints**: Map frontstage and backstage processes, showing how each touchpoint is supported by people, tools and systems.
- **Concept evaluation**: Gather feedback from users and stakeholders to refine solutions.

#### Deliver Phase

- **Implementation planning**: Develop roadmaps, identify resources and design pilots.
- **Pilot testing**: Launch small-scale trials to test viability. Collect feedback and iterate.
- **Measuring impact**: Define metrics (e.g., satisfaction, conversion rates) and use analytics to assess performance.
- **Scaling**: Integrate the service into organizational operations, aligning people, processes and technology.

### 4. Tools and Methods

The book catalogs dozens of tools, including:

- **Customer journey maps**
- **Service blueprints**
- **Personas**
- **Stakeholder maps**
- **Prototyping techniques** (e.g., role play, storyboards, physical mockups)
- **Shadowing and ethnographic observation**
- **Contextual interviews**
- **Business Model Canvas and Value Proposition Canvas**

Each tool is described with step-by-step instructions, use cases and tips.

### 5. Facilitating Collaboration

- **Workshop facilitation**: The book offers guidance on planning and running workshops. Roles include facilitator, timekeeper and scribe.
- **Mindsets**: Encourage curiosity, openness, and non‑judgmental listening. Avoid rushing to solutions.
- **Materials**: Use sticky notes, markers, prototyping supplies and flexible spaces.

### 6. Organizational Adoption

- **Embedding service design**: Integrate design thinking into organizational culture. Start small with pilot projects and champions.
- **Cross‑functional teams**: Break silos by involving representatives from different departments.
- **Measuring ROI**: Use both qualitative and quantitative metrics to demonstrate value and secure support.

### 7. Case Studies

The book includes real-world examples across sectors such as healthcare, transportation and finance. These case studies illustrate challenges, outcomes and lessons learned, demonstrating the versatility of service design.

## Conclusion

**“This Is Service Design Doing”** bridges theory and practice for service design. By combining human-centered research, co‑creation, iterative prototyping and holistic systems thinking, service designers can create services that delight customers and meet business goals. The book serves as a comprehensive manual, offering detailed guidance on processes, methods and organizational adoption to bring service design from concept to reality.
