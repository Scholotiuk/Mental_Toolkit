# Contagious Culture: Show Up, Set the Tone, and Intentionally Create an Organization that Thrives – Reference Guide

## Overview

**“Contagious Culture”** by **Anese Cavanaugh** (2015) focuses on the importance of individual presence, energy and intention in shaping organizational culture. Cavanaugh argues that culture is not a static backdrop but a dynamic state created by people’s attitudes and behaviors. By “showing up” with intentionality, leaders and employees can influence how teams feel and operate, leading to improved engagement, productivity and well‑being.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Intentional Energetic Presence (IEP)

- **IEP Framework**: The IEP Method teaches individuals to be aware of and manage their own presence (physical, emotional, energetic) and its impact on others. Being intentional about how you show up influences team dynamics.
- **Three components**:
  1. **Presence**: Awareness of one’s energy, emotions and physical state.
  2. **Intentions**: Clarifying what you want to create or achieve in interactions.
  3. **Impact**: Understanding how your presence and actions affect others.

### 2. The Impact of Culture

- **Culture starts with individuals**: People’s behaviors, attitudes and interactions shape culture. Leaders set the tone, but everyone contributes.
- **Contagious energy**: Positive (or negative) energy spreads. One person’s mood can influence an entire meeting or project.
- **Psychological safety**: When people feel safe to speak up, make mistakes and be themselves, innovation and collaboration thrive.

### 3. Showing Up

- **Self‑care**: Taking care of your health, stress and well‑being ensures you can contribute positively. Cavanaugh emphasizes sleep, nutrition and exercise.
- **Mindset and presence practices**: Techniques include mindfulness, breathing exercises and intention setting before meetings.
- **Authenticity**: Showing up authentically builds trust. Pretending or suppressing emotions can create dissonance and erode trust.

### 4. Setting the Tone

- **Leading by example**: Leaders influence culture through their actions. Demonstrating empathy, accountability and curiosity encourages others to do the same.
- **Meetings and interactions**: How you enter a room, greet people and facilitate discussions matters. Checking in with participants’ energy and purpose improves outcomes.
- **Feedback culture**: Constructive feedback fosters growth. Deliver feedback with clarity, kindness and respect.

### 5. Creating a Thriving Organization

- **Clear vision and values**: Align individual and organizational goals. People who understand and believe in the vision are more engaged.
- **Hiring and onboarding**: Recruit for cultural alignment and growth mindset. Onboarding should integrate new hires into the cultural norms and expectations.
- **Recognition and celebration**: Acknowledge achievements and positive behaviors. Celebrate milestones to reinforce desired culture.
- **Accountability**: Hold everyone responsible for their impact. Encourage self‑reflection and course correction.

## Practical Tools and Exercises

- **IEP Check‑in**: Regularly ask yourself: How am I feeling energetically? What intention do I have for this interaction? How do I want others to feel?
- **Energy audits**: Notice which activities or relationships energize you and which drain you. Adjust workloads and boundaries accordingly.
- **Team agreements**: Collaboratively create agreements for how the team will communicate, handle conflict and support each other.
- **Preparation rituals**: Before meetings, take a moment to center yourself, set an intention and consider the desired outcome.
- **Recovery practices**: After challenging interactions, debrief with yourself or a trusted colleague to learn and reset.

## Case Studies and Examples

- **Client transformations**: Cavanaugh shares stories of leaders who changed their presence and saw shifts in team morale and performance. Simple changes (e.g., starting meetings with gratitude) had significant effects.
- **Organizational turnarounds**: Companies that embraced IEP practices experienced improved retention, creativity and results.

## Criticisms and Considerations

- **Individual responsibility vs. systemic issues**: Some critics argue that focusing on individual presence may overlook structural problems (e.g., toxic leadership, inequitable policies) that affect culture. Both individual and systemic changes are needed.
- **Emotional labor**: Constantly managing one’s energy and emotions can be taxing. Cavanaugh advocates for authenticity and self‑care to mitigate this.

## Conclusion

**“Contagious Culture”** highlights how individual presence and intention can profoundly influence organizational culture. By cultivating intentional energetic presence, people can create positive, productive environments where collaboration and innovation flourish. While systemic changes are also necessary for healthy cultures, Cavanaugh provides practical tools for anyone to start shaping culture through daily actions and attitudes.
